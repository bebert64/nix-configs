    Merge home.nix
        Create home/mini.nix (for raspi)
        Include that in full.nix (for others)
    Chose what to do with software-configuration.nix

Programs to migrate
    polybar
        Fix font size in polybar
        Add all possible bars
        Add polybar section to host-specific
        Fix tray error + warning
        Add a ramp is possible for wireless signal force
        Add up / down speed for internet connection
        Investigate if possible to use weight in pulseaudio/volume ramp to use the middle one for longer
        Investigate if possible using the screens from
            for m in $(polybar --list-monitors | ${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/cut -d":" -f1); do
    ranger
        mappings and rifle (for 7z instead of zip, or for vim instead of nano)
        Use 7zip instead of zip and modify ranger command

        https://github.com/hercules-ci/nixflk/blob/template/modules/services/torrent/qbittorrent.nix
    tilix
        Check if the default color theme is good, and if so + ranger uses a color scheme => remove tilix.dconf

Host-specific
    Evaluate is "screens" can be factored with autorandr
    Check if all keys are used
    Add launch_polybar to scripts.nix
        loop over the name of the bars to launch, read from other file
        modify the lock script to use this one instead
    Simplify autorandr.hooks.postswitch
        write list of bars to external file
        exec script launch_polybar
    Remove keys which values is false and replace by `or` syntax where appropriate

    Create nix flake for rust crate and add them to home-manager
    Move dotfiles/raspi/renew-cert.sh to scripts.nix
    yank from ranger to clipboard
        Probably needs xclip

    add plugins to ranger (icons, theme, ...)
    Better script for yt-dlp
        extract name of res including 720p
        if only one => dl with it
        if > 1 => ask which to use
        if 0 => list all and ask which to use
