description: Use Deref for wrapper structs with an inner field that should be transparently accessible
globs: "**/*.rs"

When creating a wrapper struct around an inner type (e.g., adding extra fields to an existing struct), derive `Deref` targeting the inner type so callers can access the inner's methods directly without writing `.inner`.

Use `derive_more::Deref` with `#[deref]` on the inner field (works for both single and multi-field structs):

```rust
// Good: derive Deref so callers use the wrapper transparently
#[derive(derive_more::Deref)]
struct MyWrapper {
    #[deref]
    inner: InnerType,
    extra_field: bool,
}

wrapper.some_inner_method()  // calls InnerType method directly

// Bad: forcing callers to go through .inner explicitly
wrapper.inner.some_inner_method()
```
