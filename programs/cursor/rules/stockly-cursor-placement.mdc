description: Where to put Stockly-only Cursor artifacts (rules, commands, skills) — use Stockly/.cursor, not Main/.cursor
alwaysApply: true
---

When creating a **rule**, **command**, or **skill** that is Stockly-specific (Stockly tooling, conventions, DB access, workflows):

- **Do** place it under **`/home/romain/Stockly/.cursor/`** (e.g. `Stockly/.cursor/rules/`, `Stockly/.cursor/commands/`).
- **Do not** place it under **`Stockly/Main/.cursor/`**: that directory is shared with all devs and tracked in Stockly's main repo.

Use repo-local (`<workspace_root>/.cursor/`) only for artifacts that are specific to the current project's tech stack or repo structure, not for general Stockly-wide conventions.
