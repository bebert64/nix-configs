## Destructuring

- **Destructuring should be the default** — always consider it first.
- Benefits: compiler forces handling new fields, clearer code, expresses intent.
- **Only opt out with a reason**: typically verbosity when fields aren't semantically related in the current context.
- **Never use `..`** — it defeats compile-time safety. Instead: `field: _, // why not relevant here`
- Especially important for proto TryFrom/From impls — if a new field is added, compiler forces you to handle it.
- **For binary operators** (like `eq`, `cmp`, custom comparisons): destructuring `self` is enough — if a new field is added, compiler will force handling it. No need to destructure both sides.

## Exhaustive matching

- **Match exhaustively on enums by default**, especially on error/failure types.
- When ignoring errors, match each variant explicitly and comment why it's safe to ignore.
- Avoid `let _ = ...` or `Err(_)` wildcards — they hide what's being discarded.
- This ensures new variants added later force review of the handling logic.

## Imports

- Imports must be grouped using `use { ... }` syntax.
- Import groups must be separated by exactly one empty line.
- Groups are sorted in this order (each separated by one empty line):
  1. Sub-modules (`self::`)
  2. Relative modules (`super::`, `crate::`)
  3. Crate modules
  4. External libraries (including other project libraries)
- Visibility (`pub`) doesn't affect grouping — `use` and `pub use` from the same group should NOT have a newline between them.
- **Never use more than one `super::`** (e.g., `super::super::...`). Use `crate::explicit::path` instead for anything beyond immediate parent.

## Compilation and testing

- Always use `cargo check` instead of `cargo build` when just verifying compilation — it's much faster.
- Always suggest unit tests for important and non-trivial logic, even if it requires adjusting architecture slightly to make logic unit-testable.

## Database

- Migrations: only `up.sql`, never `down.sql`.
- Diesel: always use full `schema::table_name::column` path. Never import tables into scope (no `use schema::table_name;` or `use schema::table_name::dsl::*;`). For `#[derive(Selectable)]`, explicitly specify `#[diesel(table_name = schema::table_name)]`.

## Project tooling

- When entering a project with `.envrc`, run `direnv allow && eval "$(direnv export zsh)"` as your first action.
- After creating worktrees, be careful not to commit ported untracked files (hardlinks/symlinks from the main worktree).
- Place generated/temp files (scripts, intermediate outputs) in `.cursor/scratch/`. This directory should be gitignored — add it to `.gitignore` if the repo tracks `.cursor/`.
