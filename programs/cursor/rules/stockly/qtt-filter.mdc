# Quality Tech Tickets (QTT) — Filter for start-qtt-investigations

When querying the Notion database "[DB] Quality Tech Tickets" to pick pending tickets for investigation:

- **Filter on Status Intl only** for "pending": use **Status Intl** = "0 - Pending Workforce" (not the "Status" property). Status Intl is the source of truth for whether a ticket is still pending (e.g. "🟣 3 - Done" means done).
- Also apply: Assignee empty, Teams Intl does NOT contain "Partner Inputs_Front".
- **Priority order:** By Severity (SEV1 first, then SEV2 … SEV5 last), then by Updated At descending. SEV4 must rank before SEV5. The Notion API sort by Severity may not return that order, so use **page_size 100** and rely on the parser (`parse_qtt.py`) to re-sort.
